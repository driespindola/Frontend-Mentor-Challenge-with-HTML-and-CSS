### What I learned

```
 css
 .nft-box {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-top: 60px;
    margin-bottom: 100px;
    padding: 3px;
    max-width: 300px;
    max-height: 570px;
    background-color: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
    box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px black;
    border-radius: 20px;
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning flexbox and box-shadow. Also learning about how to make the site responsive for mobile users.
